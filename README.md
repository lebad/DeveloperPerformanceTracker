## Why I Built This
I wanted a simple way to stay motivated and be more productive every day. Just a quiet progress bar in my menu bar that reminds me to keep shipping code.
I've been using this app myself for months, and it's helped me build better coding habits. Now I'm sharing it with you. Hope it helps you too! 🚀
